# Codanna Init

Use this skill when the current repository should be prepared for Codanna so the MCP server can start successfully.

## Goals

- Confirm `codanna` is installed and available.
- Initialize the current repository for Codanna.
- Build the first project index.
- Build the semantic embedding index when indexable content is present.
- Verify that the workspace is ready for `codanna serve --watch`.

## Workflow

1. If `codanna` is missing, run `./install_codanna.sh` from the `codanna-install` skill directory first.
2. In the same shell, resolve the executable with `command -v codanna`. The launcher checks `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, and the inherited `PATH`.
3. Verify installation with the resolved executable:
   `CODANNA_BIN="$(command -v codanna)"`
   `"$CODANNA_BIN" --version`
4. In the target repository, run `"$CODANNA_BIN" init` if `.codanna/settings.toml` does not exist yet.
5. Build the initial index with `"$CODANNA_BIN" index .`.
6. Confirm readiness:
   `test -f .codanna/settings.toml`
   `test -d .codanna/index`
7. Verify that semantic embeddings were built:
   `"$CODANNA_BIN" mcp get_index_info`
   Check the code index and `Semantic Search` sections. If symbols, files, or embeddings are still `0`, report that Codanna exists but semantic search is not ready yet.
8. Optionally run `"$CODANNA_BIN" mcp-test` to confirm the MCP tool surface is available.

## Notes

- This skill is for project bootstrap, not binary installation alone.
- This plugin is Apple Silicon macOS-only and expects `codanna` to resolve from `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, or the inherited `PATH`.
- Do not assume the user's shell already resolves `codanna`; prefer the resolved `CODANNA_BIN` path from the installation shell.
- `codanna index .` should build both the symbol index and the semantic embedding index when the project contains supported, indexable content.
- If `get_index_info` reports `Embeddings: 0`, do not claim semantic search is ready. Call out the reason when it is visible, for example an empty code index, missing model assets, or unsupported project content.
- The Codanna launcher in this plugin will refuse to start when `.codanna/settings.toml`, `.codanna/index/`, or a useful non-empty code index is missing.
- After this skill completes, the plugin launcher should be able to refresh the index and start MCP normally.
